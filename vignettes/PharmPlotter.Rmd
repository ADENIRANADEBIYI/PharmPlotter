```

First, we load the package into the working R session and
load the summarizedData into the working session. 

```{r loadData}
library(PharmPlotter)
data("summarizedData")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure}
plotAUCConsistency( data=summarizedData, drugName="AZD0530")
```
